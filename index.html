<h3>Conductor Track</h3> 
You'll view this video of Doug conducting as you make your recording.
<ul>
    <li>The Conductor track file is in the <a href="https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/11lYDtTxZhL1HikaAJ42ntigtkwFgi6kT">Google Drive folder</a> and is called
    <b>Rutter Gloria 1st Movement Conductor Track.mp4</b></li>
    <li>DOWNLOAD the Conductor track to your computer/phone. Do not stream it from the Google Drive folder.</li>
    <li>Keep your headphones unplugged until after you hear horns at the start of the conductor track.<br>
    (Your microphone will pick up the horns allowing us to syncronize everyone's recordings.)</li>
    <li>After the horns sounds for a couple of seconds, plug in your headphones, so your microphone captures only your voice, not the conductor track.</li>
</ul>
